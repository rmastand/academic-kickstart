abstract: "We explore the metric space of jets using public collider data from the CMS experiment. Starting from 2.3/fb of 7 TeV proton-proton collisions collected at the Large Hadron Collider in 2011, we isolate a sample of 1,690,984 central jets with transverse momentum above 375 GeV. To validate the performance of the CMS detector in reconstructing the energy flow of jets, we compare the CMS Open Data to corresponding simulated data samples for a variety of jet kinematic and substructure observables. Even without detector unfolding, we find very good agreement for track-based observables after using charged hadron subtraction to mitigate the impact of pileup. We perform a range of novel analyses, using the 'energy mover's distance' (EMD) to measure the pairwise difference between jet energy flows. The EMD allows us to quantify the impact of detector effects, visualize the metric space of jets, extract correlation dimensions, and identify the most and least typical jet configurations. To facilitate future jet studies with CMS Open Data, we make our datasets and analysis code available, amounting to around two gigabytes of distilled data and one hundred gigabytes of simulation files."
