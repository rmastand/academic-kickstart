title: Analyzing CMS Open Collider Data through Topic Modeling

location: BOOST 2019 Physics Workshop


summary: ""
abstract: "We investigate jet substructure at the Large Hadron Collider with the CMS Open Data. We analyze a sample of jets from 2.3/fb of 7 TeV proton-proton collisions detected by the CMS experiment in 2011 with the companion simulated (both pre- and post-detector) datasets, focusing on a high-quality sample of jets with transverse momenta restricted to between 375 and 425 GeV. We further move to a specific analysis of jet classification using the unsupervised algorithm of jet topics to provide a new way of defining the categories of quark and gluon jets through their observable properties."
